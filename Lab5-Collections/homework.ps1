<#
Using data structures you learnt in this module, create a function that builds a file tree from a given path
The file tree should keep a structure of folders and files
Start with Get-ChildItem -Path parameter, do not use "Recurse" parameter!
Tips:
    - You can use GetType() to distinguish between folders and files
    - You might need to use a few data structures e.g. hashtable and an array to achieve this goal
    - You might find writing your own recursion particularly useful in this exercise
